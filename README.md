### Difference between _Debian_ and _CentOS_
Debian and CentOS are both popular Linux distributions, but they have some key differences:

1. **Package Management:**
	- **Debian** uses the APT (Advanced Package Tool) package management system, making it easy to install, update, and remove software.
	- **CentOS** uses the YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) package management system, which simplifies the process of managing software packages.

2. **Release Cycle:**
	- **Debian** has a more flexible release cycle, with a stable version released when it is deemed ready. It tends to prioritize stability over having the latest software.
	- **CentOS** follows a more rigid release cycle and is known for its long-term support (LTS) releases. It is often used in enterprise environments for its stability.

3. **Community vs. Enterprise Focus:**
	- **Debian** is community-driven and is known for its inclusiveness and commitment to free software principles.
	- **CentOS** is derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and is geared more towards enterprise environments, with a focus on stability and support.

4. **Systemd:**
	- **Debian** adopted the systemd init system with Debian 8 (Jessie), which manages the initialization process and system services.
	- **CentOS** also switched to systemd with CentOS 7, aligning with the direction many Linux distributions took in adopting this init system.
5. **Default Software Versions:**
	- **Debian** often includes older but stable versions of software in its repositories to prioritize system stability.
	- **CentOS**, being more enterprise-focused, might include slightly older software versions compared to bleeding-edge distributions.
