# 42 COMMON CORE
Here lies my first couple of projects of the 42 common core curriculum!
Sweat and tears were spilled in all these projects!

Hi future Andrew! at the time of writing this it is 15<sup>th</sup> Jan 2024 and you have validated Libft and ft_printf.  
Born2Beroot is almost finalised, you just need to revise a bit to know all the commands and how to answer all the questions!  
I hope you are doing good and that you are absolutely smashing the common core!
